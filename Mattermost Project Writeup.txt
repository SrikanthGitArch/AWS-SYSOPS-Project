
Implementing a Team Communication Solution Using Mattermost and AWS.

DESCRIPTION

You are a Cloud engineer working on a Team Communication Solution project for a big MNC. The client has compliance policies which do not allow them to use services managed by third parties.
The client wants a team communication solution that can be managed and hosted on servers that are controlled by them.

Steps to Perform:

Implement two different subnets (one public and the other private) in a custom VPC
Install and configure MySQL on an Ubuntu 18.04 instance on the private subnet (Hint: Use a bastion host and a NAT instance)
Install and configure Mattermost on an Ubuntu 18.04 instance on the public subnet
Configure the security groups to allow the ports
Test the installation by accessing the IP of the public instance in a browser
